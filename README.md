⚠️ Challenges Faced
1. Managing and Displaying Data

Challenge: Handling a large number of employee records efficiently and ensuring fast search/filter operations.

Solution: Implemented client-side filtering and pagination; considered server-side search for scalability.

2. Implementing Search Functionality

Challenge: Making the search feature flexible (e.g., matching partial names, case-insensitive).

Solution: Used JavaScript’s toLowerCase() and includes() methods to perform more user-friendly searches.

3. Data Integration

Challenge: Connecting the frontend to an API or external data source (e.g., employee database or JSON file).

Solution: Used fetch() or Axios to retrieve data asynchronously and handled loading/error states gracefully.
